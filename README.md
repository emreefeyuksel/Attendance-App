A zero-backend attendance app that runs on GitHub Pages using localStorage.

- Instructor: username `Orkun Karabasoglu`, password `123456`
- Students: log in with student number (sample: `18070000013`, `19070001053`, `19070008012`)
- 6-digit code rotates every 30s; Excel export included.

## Run
Open `index.html` or deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

2. Commit all files to the `main` branch.
3. In repo Settings â†’ Pages, set Source to `Deploy from a branch`, Branch `main` (root).
